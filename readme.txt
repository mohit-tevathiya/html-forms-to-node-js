This repository primarly covers sending data from input tag of form to the node js backend.

Installation:
 npm i


How does this work ?

1)input tag has name attribute which could be accessed into the req from 
backend 
2)res from the backend sends the response to the frontend 

Middlewares used :

body parser.json() : new body object is created and populated to request object after parsing to JSON
